# RME_FoundryVTT_Module
Homebrew credits go to Commander Fayne. Credit to Nalgenes for the original code.
This is still a work in progress and I am new to foundry modules. 

Currently the only features that are functioning are the check boxes for weapon proficiencies and weapon proporties. 


TO DOWNLOAD!

Drag and drop the folder "revised-martial-equipment" into your Foundry modulal folder. 

If you're using the applicaton you can right click on foundry and select "Brows User Data".
From there select the "Data" folder.
Then select the modules folder
Drag and drop the folder mentioned above into this location.


For forge users... Sorry. I got no clue.
